An introduction to the ecosystem of Innovation in Aviation (from ICAO's point of view)

The Network is defined by "Innovaiton Points"  that is anything tangible such as a document, an event, an outfit; and "Physical Connections" which is where two points have been in physical contact (so attendance at an event, meeting between outfits, prodcution of a document).

The Innovation Points are in the file "raw3dmapdata.csv"  and the Connections are in the file "Lines.csv"

These are combined and plotted as a 3d scatter chart in Plotly.  The resulting file can be viewed here : https://innovation4aviation.github.io/healthychaos/docs/NONsmall-lables.html

Thanks for reading up to this point.
